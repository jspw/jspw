## About Me

I have been involved in learning and creating tech stuffs from the very first year (2018) of my [university](https://www.sust.edu/) life. During these days, I was involved in exploring IT sector & solving problems (CP) in different online judges including [Codeforces](http://www.codeforces.com/profile/shifat57), [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/users/shifat_57), [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/vampire_5?hr_r=1), [UVA](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/id/945442), lightOj etc and solved about **1000** problems with **c/c++** and **python**.

I love to learn core and fundamental concepts and build tools/applications.

I have a solid background in building robust & scalable web based applications with **NodeJs** (_Express_, _NestJs_), **Spring Framework** (_Springboot_), **ReactJs** and **NextJs**. I have also a little experience in building cross platform mobile applications with Flutter and Dart. I have a good understanding of database management system (SQL, NoSQL) and have worked with **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, Oracle, Firebase, Firestore etc.

Recently (2024) I had **lead** a small team (5) of developers and QAs where we developed and successfully **released** a **Sales & Marketing Product** for **Banks & Credit Unions** in **USA**. The application contains **10+ microservices** written in a hybrid software & framework stack which includes **Springboot**, **JSP**(_HTML_, _CSS_, _Javascript_, _Jquery_), **React**, **Hapi**(legacy), **Express**, **Docker**, **Gitlab CI-CD** etc. I have been involved in **requirements analysis & feature enhancement with clients**, **Design & Architecture** of the System and **deployments**.

Apart from that, I have worked with local (**BD**) and international (**UK**, **Japanese**, **USA**) clients as my **side projects** where I have developed **E-com** based mobile applications, **CRM** and **CMS** based web applications.

I also have handful experience in Google Console Play, **Digital Ocean**, **AWS**, Hostinger(VPS), Render and **Vercel**.
