## About Me

I have been involved in learning and creating tech stuff from the very first year (2018) of my [university](https://www.sust.edu/) life. During student life I was involved in solving competitive problems and have solved about 1000+ problems in different online judges including [Codeforces](http://www.codeforces.com/profile/shifat57), [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/users/shifat_57), [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/vampire_5?hr_r=1), [UVA](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/id/945442), lightOj etc.

I love to build system tools or applications. I have also contributed in open source projects. I have a open source android launcher called ["Ubuntu Launcher"](https://github.com/jspw/Ubuntu-Launcher) in github which have 6.1k total downloads, about 3k current version downloads and 250 stars in github.

I have worked on web applications as well as mobile applications. I believe my core expertise is in backend development. I mainly work with NodeJs (ExpressJs) and Spring framework (SpringBoot, JPA, Hybernate) in backend, React on frontend and Flutter for cross platform applications.

Till now (2022), I have finished 5 client based projects. I have two mobile (android) applications in playstore and two web applications in production.
